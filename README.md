# Gears

## Description
Gears is an Android app I made back in college to help me fix my car. It's completely outdated at this point, but I've made the code open source.

Gears lets you:
* Diagnose fault codes

* View live information - Temperatures, speed, RPM, acceleration, and pressures

* Test your system for misfires, sensor malfunctions, and more

In order to use Gears, you need a Bluetooth OBD2 ELM327 adapter, easily found online (Amazon or eBay). Higher quality adapters will refresh your live data quicker, but otherwise function the exact same as cheaper ones.

Most vehicles after 1996 are compatible with this app. Newer FORD vehicles may have inaccurate results from System Testing.
